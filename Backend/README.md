Backend Server / API

This is the backend server for your application, built using Node.js and Express. The backend is responsible for handling API requests and communicating with the database.
Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend server:
1. Install Dependencies

Before starting the backend server, make sure to install all necessary third-party packages.

    Navigate to the backend directory (where this README.md file is located).
    Run the following command to install the required packages:

    npm install

    This will look at the package.json file and fetch all the dependencies listed there. These packages help the backend work with the database, manage routes, and handle other server-side tasks.

2. Configure the Database

The backend needs to connect to a database to store and retrieve data. The configuration for this connection is located in the config/db.js file. If you have any changes to make (e.g., changing the database host or credentials), this is where you can do that.

3. Start the Server

Once the dependencies are installed and the configuration is set up, you can start the server.

Run the following command to start the server:

    node index.js
    
This will start the backend server, which will be ready to handle API requests.

4. Server Output

When the server starts, it may not do much right away, as the core API functionality is still being set up. Once the necessary routes and logic are added, the server will respond to requests and send data back to the frontend.
Project Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the key files and directories in the backend server:
index.js

This is the main entry point of the backend server. It initializes the server, sets up the necessary middleware, and defines how the server handles incoming requests.
config/

This directory contains configuration files for the backend.

    db.js: Contains the database connection details (e.g., host, username, password). This file allows the backend to communicate with the database.

routes/

This directory contains the routes for the API, where the actual logic for handling requests is defined.

    api.js: This file contains all the Express routes for the backend API. It defines how the server handles requests to specific endpoints (e.g., GET, POST) and what data to send in response.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

    Database Connection: Double-check the config/db.js file to ensure the database connection settings are correct.
    Missing Dependencies: If you get errors about missing packages, make sure to run npm install in the backend directory to fetch the necessary dependencies.
    Server Not Starting: If the server doesn’t start, look at the error message in the terminal. It may provide helpful information about what's missing or wrong.

Next Steps

Once the server is up and running, the next steps would be to:

    Add API logic in the routes/api.js file.
    Set up your database schema and data models.
    Test API routes using tools like Postman or through the frontend.
