This is currently the default configuration for the Backend Server / API. I've initially set it up to use Node.js which is a server side rendering tool that has tons of support and third party libraries that we can use. It actually pulls from the same place that the frontend pulls its libraries. Like the Frontend, in order to make sure all of the third party packages are installed, naviage to the main directory of the frontend (which contains the package.json), and run *npm install* to fetch all of the current packages. 
When you want to start up the server, run *node index.js* 
It'll not do much right now, as all of the files are empty, but onces the base configuration has been added you should see more effects.
